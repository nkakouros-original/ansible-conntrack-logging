conntrack_logging_enabled: true
# Set to false to completely disable this role.

conntrack_logging_timer_period: 28s
# How often the conntrack table should be read. This must be in systemd time
# format (see
# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html). By
# default, conntrack entries expire after 30 seconds. To not flood systemd's
# journal with many, almost identical lines, I have chosen `28s`, which makes
# sure that lines will appear maximum twice.

conntrack_logging_conntrack_options: '-L conntrack -o ktimestamp -o id -o extended'
# A string of options to pass to the conntrack utility that is used to read the
# conntrack table.
